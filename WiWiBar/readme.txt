What is WiWiBar ?

Was it Worth it Bar is for people that like to farm and know what they are actually looting. It displays statistics about the amount of credits/xp/renown/items that you earned during a farming session. It also provide a window that show items looted during the session, and you can select some of them to create new tracking tab on top of the screen.

How to use it ?

Open the loot window : /wiwi

Once you've looted an item, you can select it from the window "Loots" and press "Track", this will add a tab in top of your screen that display the items/hour and total.
You can select the value you want to see on the top of the tab, by clicking on it.
To have a tab always unfolded, check the little blue point on the top left of it.
You can hide the blue bar via the settings window ( /wiwi )
If you moved tabs, you can also reset their position in the settings window.
 
What will be improved ?

I plan to save the sessions data to be able to compare differents sessions.

Display more data (if you have any suggestion).

Visual settings.

Maybe start automatically a session when entering a dungeon, and display the result at the end.
