User Comment:
+"some QoL improvements i'd like to ask for, first i saw you added tabs to whispers that's great but would love auto
	grouping of whisper tabs, its not important but instead of dragging them manually would be nice."
+"The 2nd QoL option i'd like is instead of switching to new whisper tab, while having another one on focus
	would be cool if you could just make the tab you recieved a whisper on "flash at name" rather than switch to it."
